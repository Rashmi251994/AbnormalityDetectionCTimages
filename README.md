# AbnormalityDetectionCTimages
This project proposes two phases. In the first phase, determined the best filter for DICOM CT images by applying various filters using MTLAB. I found the combination of Median; Gaussian and CLAHE filters will give best result.  In the second phase, Applied ostu and watershed segmentation algorithm and compared the accuracy. This project got the accuracy of 91.6%.
